# Simple REST API with Codeigniter 4



## Installation

I've created a make file that contains the following commands:

1. This will build the docker image
```bash
make build
```
1. This will power up the containers and install the dependencies for the project
```bash
make up-dev
```
After that open your browser and go to http://localhost:8000


## Improvements

1. Add the phpunit tests to the pipeline
2. User interfaces for the book service
3. Add OpenAPI documentation
